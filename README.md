My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) 2021 solutions in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).


Disclaimer
----------

This is my first time writing Rust (beyond a few hello worlds and syntax testing snippets), so the
code is probably pretty far from idiomatic rust.. in fact you could call it *idiotic rust*. 🥁😜


Notes for myself
----------------

### Code formatting

```console
$ rustup component add rustfmt
$ cargo fmt
```


### Running tests

```console
$ cargo test
```
